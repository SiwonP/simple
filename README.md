# vue-simple-boilerplate

> The simplest possible Vue setup in a simpler webpack environment that the webpack Vue setup

> This template is Vue 2.0 compatible.

### Before You Start...

This boilerplate is targeted at beginners who want to start exploring Vue without the distraction of a complicated development environment.

For advanced features such as asset compilation, hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing, and CSS extraction, we recommend that more experienced developers use one of the [other templates](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/).

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli              # Install vue-cli if you haven't already
$ vue init SiwonP/simple my-project   # Create a new project based on this template
$ cd my-project                       # Navigate into your new project folder

$ npm install                         # Install npm dependencies and dev dependencies
$ npm run dev                         # Run development server which should open at localhost:8080 with auto refresh
$ npm run build                       # Run build of the bundle.js in the dist folder
```
